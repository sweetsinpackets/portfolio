              <p>Hello, here's my sincere greeting! I think my work and research speaks for me honestly, so please refer to the two pages. I think my work and research can better help you know my ability instead of keep reading this if you're my potential employee.</p>
              <p>I developed my interest in computer early in my childhood. As early in my primary school, I was able to "tear apart" and "re-assemble" a Thinkpad laptop (that's why I'm a fan of Thinkpad). Then I studied C++ programming in my high school and developed some tools for the school. I could have become a good programmer if I was not hooked in computer games. I was enrolled in a WoW pfu realm, which takes me several hours per-day, so I wasn't able to keep practising my skills in programming. In my second year of undergraduate, I found my interest in AI because the application seems really cool. So I went to Lenovo Research for research intern, but I was disappointed a little bit because no one can tell me clearly why the neural network learns. To find the answer of the question, I learned and worked in a SJTU AI lab for half a year, read through the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book and reported several edge-cutting papers on approximate inference. Though the experience actually expands my view and knowledge, I can't really feel myself working on something meaningful or cool.
              </p>
              <p>After quit from AI, I "self-studied" the Software Foundation book and get interested in formal verification. As soon as I went to UM for master degree, I found a research opportunity in formal verification. As a newbie, the days were hard at first. It occurs quite often that I stayed-up several days to prove a theorem and found the theorem I wrote was initially wrong, so I actually made no progress even with lots of efforts. However, the experience never weaken my enthusiasm, and I even found another opportunity in programming language, a co-related area. Since I'm currently on my way to the end of my master degree, I am finding opportunities to stay in the field, i.e. a Ph.D or a job.</p>
              <p>Besides my skills, I am (or at least once) someone playing with arts. I started and kept my practice in piano and Chinese calligraphy early in my kindergarten, and definitely, have some awards. I played with several kinds of art, including novel, photograph, music, song, and microfilm. So, a good-bye from a potential artist, and thanks for your reading.</p>
